## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pug
- Sass

### What I learned

I learned the handling of the box model applying the corresponding design with html and css creating a responsive interface.


### Continued development

I love using the concept of reusing parts of the code to create another card but keeping the same styles or changing the content and keeping the styles.
